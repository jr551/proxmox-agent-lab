# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and releases use
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Guarded clicks accept legitimate two-character control labels such as
  Haiku's `OK` button while continuing to reject empty and one-character
  targets.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Console input commands can capture a settled post-action screenshot in the
  same response with `--screenshot-after`.
- Coordinate clicks now require one visible target label and perform their own
  vision-confirmed cursor checkpoint; the self-confirmation flag is gone.
- A bounded GUI-installer playbook gives small models a deterministic workflow
  and delegates graphical checkpoints to vision instead of external OCR.
- An opt-in, lease-bound `console inspect` wrapper tries NVIDIA Nemotron Nano
  12B v2 VL, the named OpenRouter Nemotron Omni free endpoint, then
  `openrouter/free`, using keys from the OS secret store.

### Fixed

- Cold lab starts now use the configured boot timeout and reject waits shorter
  than 90 seconds, preventing premature failure and duplicate leases.
- Git audit sync now keeps the local SQLite ledger queryable while copying
  redacted JSONL records to a dedicated private `logs` branch.
- A project-scoped OpenRouter key now wins over a stale inherited shell key;
  free-router singleton JSON responses are normalized and validated.
- Cloud vision receives a labelled, same-size 100-pixel coordinate grid while
  the original screenshot remains untouched. Failed, ambiguous, and timed-out
  cursor verdicts cannot click, and agents are explicitly stopped from using
  reboots or storage mutations as GUI recovery.
- Log sync fails closed on a dirty checkout and can stage only the daily
  journal file, preventing source edits from entering audit commits.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-08

First public beta release of the leased, auditable Proxmox lab controller.

### Added

- “Old Computer → AI Lab” public-facing identity for authorized research.
- GitHub CI, contribution guidance, responsible-use guidance, security policy,
  and structured issue templates.
- Per-site Windows template configuration and a `--template-vmid` override.

### Fixed

- Windows 2022 installs now select the `2k22` VirtIO driver directory by
  default instead of inheriting the Windows 2025 default.
- Console-share tests now close HTTP responses and server sockets cleanly.
