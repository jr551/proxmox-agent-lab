## Unreleased

### Added

- Console input commands can capture a settled post-action screenshot in the
  same response with `--screenshot-after`.
- Coordinate clicks now use a vision-confirmed cursor calibration, cached per
  lease and resolution and automatically invalidated on resolution changes.
- A bounded GUI-installer playbook gives small models a deterministic workflow
  and delegates graphical checkpoints to vision instead of external OCR.
- An opt-in, lease-bound `console inspect` wrapper sends one PNG to NVIDIA
  Nemotron Nano 12B v2 VL using a key from the OS secret store.

### Fixed

- Cold lab starts now use the configured boot timeout and reject waits shorter
  than 90 seconds, preventing premature failure and duplicate leases.
- Git audit sync now keeps the local SQLite ledger queryable while copying
  redacted JSONL records to a dedicated private `logs` branch.
- Log sync fails closed on a dirty checkout and can stage only the daily
  journal file, preventing source edits from entering audit commits.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-08

First public beta release of the leased, auditable Proxmox lab controller.

### Added

- “Old Computer → AI Lab” public-facing identity for authorized research.
- GitHub CI, contribution guidance, responsible-use guidance, security policy,
  and structured issue templates.
- Per-site Windows template configuration and a `--template-vmid` override.

### Fixed

- Windows 2022 installs now select the `2k22` VirtIO driver directory by
  default instead of inheriting the Windows 2025 default.
- Console-share tests now close HTTP responses and server sockets cleanly.
